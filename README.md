# BuildNeural

A repository for learning how neural networks actually work by building them from scratch.

No black boxes. No magic. Just code, math, and understanding.

We start with a single neuron and build up to deep learning architectures, implementing everything in NumPy to see exactly what's happening under the hood.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamadhanAdam/buildneural.git
cd buildneural
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Browse the folders. Each one is a complete lesson with working code.
